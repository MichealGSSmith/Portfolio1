            <h2>College Cap-Stone Project</h2>
    
            <p>This is my capstone project, the final assignment needed to actually obtain my diploma! I worked with two other student developers in my class as well as a business owner off of Riipen. We mainly used HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, and Bootstrap! Take a peak at the images I have and enjoy!</p>

          <h2>Home Page</h2>
          <p class="description">This is the home page created by my fellow developer Nazanin. This is the initial information on the clients ideas and buttons leading to the contact form. I was only responsible for making the logo in the browser tab and to proof over her work.</p>

          <h2>About Us Page</h2>
          <p class="description">This is the About us page and it was used to describe the company of Aisha Home living, our clients overall brand and introduce who our client is as well as having buttons to the contact page. I was the author of this page!</p>

          <h2>Invest With Us</h2>
          <p class="description">This is the Invest With Us page, the goal was to give future investors information as to what they were investing in and what would be offered to residents of the co-housing project. This page was authored by my fellow developer Matia. I was responsible for embedding the youtube video of the co-housing development onto this page.</p>

          <h2>Contact Us</h2>
          <p class="description">This was the page I was in charge of. Its main goal is to allow future investors or possible residents to email Aisha directly to get more information. I wrote the PHP script in the backend to send this completed form to Aisha and formatted the data she would recieve to make it easier to read when she opened the email.</p>

          <h2>Mobile Version</h2>
          <p class="description">Part of the requirment was to make our project mobile friendly. This is what it looked like on a Iphone 11 Pro</p>
